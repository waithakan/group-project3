                    the moment.‚ÄúPhotography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. 
                    What you have caught on film is captured forever‚Ä¶ 
                    It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything.‚Äù</p>

                    in return. I am having a relationship with this pizza, almost an affair.</p>

                <p id="p-set1">Surely there are relationships with people, but then there are also really 
                    special relationships with things that define you. A car can be a truly 
                    valuable asset for some of us ‚Äì and its money worth is not the reason.</p>

                    happiness, and comfort, and it brings us together to enjoy life‚Äôs greatest moments. 
                    Some of our fondest memories consist of drinking in the dorms with our college roommates, 
                    or toasting your best friend at their wedding, or simply celebrating the arrival of the new year.</p>
